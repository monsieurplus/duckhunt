duckhunt
========

An HTML5 Duck Hunt clone made with canvas and JS

This version is still in development.

What works :
- You can launch Game A
- Watch a dog jump in the grass
- Shot lovely 3 colors ducks flying around
- Rage at a laughing dog if you missed
- Play from round 1 to 99 (it should become harder and harder)

What is still to be done :
- Increase scoring as in original game
- Increase difficulty as in original game (much faster than mine)
- When the dog show the duck he picked up, it's not always centered on the screen (place it near where the duck felt)
- Fullscreen mode (it currently runs in the original NES resolution 256x224) which is less than a poststamp on retina display
- Touch events for touch devices (phones, tablets...)
- Make it work with wii pointer to be as close as possible from the original game
- Sounds (probably with soundJS)
- Avoid to let the ducks fly forever (implement a timer)
- Pause mode (I still don't know how to do it...)
- Game B / Game C
