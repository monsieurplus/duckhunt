HTML5 Duck Hunt
===============

A HTML5 Nintendo Duck Hunt clone made with canvas and JS.
This version is still in development.

What works
----------
* You can launch Game A
* Watch a dog jump in the grass
* Shot lovely 3 colors ducks flying around
* Rage at a laughing dog if you missed
* Play from round 1 to 99 (it becomes harder and harder)

What still has to be done
-------------------------
* When the dog show the duck he picked up, it should not always be centered on the screen (it should be placed next where the duck felt)
* Fullscreen mode (it currently runs in the original NES resolution 256x224) which is less than a poststamp on retina display
* Add fake CRT effect like the one made by Zachary Johnson : http://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2012/08/17/webgl-fake-crt-html5.html (should be optionnal)
* Touch events for touch devices (phones, tablets...)
* Make it work with wii pointer to be as close as possible from the original game
* Sounds (probably with soundJS)
* Pause mode (I still don't know how to do it...)
* Game B / Game C
* use WebGL-2D : https://github.com/corbanbrook/webgl-2d

Oh ! And you can try a demo [here](http://adrienmas.com/labs/duckhunt/ "HTML5 Duck Hunt")
